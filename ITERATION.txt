My p2_gold_spike feedback talked about adding sprite outlines because the player characters are hard to see 
when they're on the same background, adding a more appealing background/tiles, fixing player movement, as well 
as general suggestions to flesh out my game more (e.g. adding a main menu, pause menu, audio/music, more 
interesting levels, etc).

As a result of my feedback, I added sprite outlines and fixed the player's rigidbody movement 
so that they don't have momentum. These two seemed to be the biggest issues people were facing.
To further improve the game experience, I did add a main menu, pause menu, background music,
some sound effects, and I also made the camera movement keep all characters within the screen at all times, 
since before this the camera would reposition to the center of both characters but would not zoom.
I made the color of the background and wall tiles colors that I thought would better suit the theme of my 
game (ghosts / nighttime), but didn't add a background image or special tiles because honestly, I ran out 
of time. Finally, the most "game-changing" elements I added were moving tiles, tiles that would change color,
and switches to trigger the color change, attempting to arrange these elements in an engaging way throughout
certain levels.
