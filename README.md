# EECS 494: Project 2
## Yuurei
Format: 2D platformer

Player has two bodies that they switch between and use to navigate through obstacles. The bodies can only move in areas of their respective color + grey zones.
### CONTROLS
- Use arrow keys to move left, move right, and jump
- Press SPACE to fly
- Press SHIFT to switch between the two bodies
### MECHANICS
- Bodies can only move on backgrounds of their respective color
- Both bodies can move on grey zones --> goal is always in a grey zone
- Both bodies must reach the goal in order to win
- A body dies when it is exposed to the wrong color for too long --> game automatically resets.
### TASKS
1. Create switch functionality with indicator for which one you are
2. Kill body when it enters the wrong area and reset level
3. Create example level with black, white, and grey backgrounds with goal
4. Create character sprites
## Inspiration
- Fire boy and water girl

Considerations: gravity + flying or always floating?
