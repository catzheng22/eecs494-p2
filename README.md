# EECS 494 Project 2
## Yuurei
- Format: 2D platformer
- Player has two ghosts that they switch between and use to navigate through obstacles. Ghosts can only move in areas of their respective color + grey zones.
### Controls
Use arrow keys to move left, move right, and jump
Press SPACE to fly
Press SHIFT to switch between the two bodies
### Mechanics
- White ghost can only move on light backgrounds
- Black ghost can only move on dark backgrounds
- Both bodies can move on grey zones --> goal is always in a grey zone
- Both bodies must reach the goal in order to win
- A body dies when it is exposed to the wrong color for too long --> game automatically resets.
### TASKS
1. Create character sprites for movement
2. Create switch functionality with indicator for which one you are
3. Kill body when it enters the wrong area and reset level
4. Create example level with black, white, and grey backgrounds with goal
## INSPIRATION
- Fire boy and water girl
Considerations: gravity + flying or always floating?
